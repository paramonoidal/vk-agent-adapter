/**
 * VK channel diagnostics: three levels instead of on/off.
 *
 * The old `VK_VOICE_DEBUG_LOG` was all-or-nothing and wrote whole paths, URLs
 * and peer identifiers to a file, so it could not be turned on for a live
 * channel. Dropping the switch would be wrong too: it is what revealed why
 * pictures arrived as grey file cards. So the switch stayed and became a level:
 *
 * | level      | what is visible |
 * |------------|-----------------|
 * | `off`      | nothing (default); failures are still logged — see below |
 * | `redacted` | progress without names: attachment kind, size, MIME, attempt, code |
 * | `full`     | the same plus paths, URLs, file names and identifiers |
 *
 * **Redaction is a property of this channel, not caller discipline.** Callers
 * pass one field map and never split it into allowed and forbidden: `redactField`
 * below decides, from the name of the field and the type of the value.
 *
 * **Below `full`, nothing free-form survives.** The previous version tried to
 * recognise paths and addresses inside text and strip them, and that is a losing
 * game: a Unicode path, a relative one, a data URI in the middle of an error
 * message — each escaped one pattern or another. So the rule is an allowlist:
 * identifiers are hashed (by name, numbers and strings alike), counters and
 * booleans pass, any other number becomes `<number>`, a handful of named fields
 * may carry a short token (`kind=photo`, `mime=image/jpeg`), a source field is
 * replaced by its kind (`local` / `remote` / `data`), and any other string —
 * an error message included — becomes the constant `<text>`. An error is
 * reported by its class, its numeric code and its `errno`-style code, which is
 * enough to tell an `ENOENT` from an `APIError 100` without carrying the path
 * or the request parameters along.
 *
 * At `full`, text is kept but not attachment contents: a data URI under a
 * source field is replaced by its type, name and size, and any other text is
 * cut at its first data URI — the payload is not picked out, it goes with the
 * rest of the text. The core's secret redactor runs over what is left, plus
 * our own pass for what it does not cover — a VK access token, bare or in a
 * URL's query string.
 *
 * Failures are always logged, even at `off`: they are redacted as at
 * `redacted`, and a channel that stays silent about an error is the very trap
 * that once turned a VK breakage into half a day of searching.
 *
 * Where it goes: the core logger (`runtime.logging.getChildLogger`) — it knows
 * levels, rotation and file permissions, and needs no sink of its own.
